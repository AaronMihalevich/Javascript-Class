      <h1>My Name is Aaron Mihalevich</h1>
      <p>I enjoy many things in life. I have always had a strong passion for art and design but in a digital form.
        I gravitated to Photoshop at a young age and was mostly self taught. I was motivated by the exceptional power that
        the software gave me. So many features and functions to express my creativity. This led me to pursue a graphic design degree at OTC.
        After graduated I found a job in a windowless room with very little creative output. After only 9 months of this I quit my job and started
        selling outdoor gear and supplies at Ozark Adventures in Springfield. I've always had a strong passion for the outdoors and in the years leading
        up to this job I had become hooked on spending my free time exploring. I loved this job but the extreme discounts didn't hurt.</p>
